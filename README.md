# Allen West

## About Me
I am a Security Researcher currently working with some of the world's best engineers and hackers on Akamai's Security Intelligence Response Team. Since Akamai's customer base represents a large chunk of the internet, most of my/our current focus is on scalable threats like botnets operators and Nation State campaigns. I also love writing code, designing systems, offensive security, and I even enjoy writing policy and research blog posts about all of it. Below is all of the work I have done in the Cyber Security domain, and I hope it protrays sufficiently the level of passion I have for this "career". It means a lot to me and I am excited to be able to share it with anyone who is interested. Thanks!
